# Plant Seedlings Classification

Here is the link to the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification">competition page</a>. This is a pretty simple convolutional neural network based model which achieves a MeanFScore of 0.89 on the public test dataset. You should use this piece of code to understand, experiment and create your own model; this is by no means my final code which I will release after the competition ends.
